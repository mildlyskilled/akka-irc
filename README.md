Forked from: https://github.com/mildlyskilled/akka-irc

A simple IRC-like client and server implementation in Scala and Akka. Thanks to the guys from LSUG for contributions to making it more Scala-esque. 

How to run
===========

This program requires an installation of the Simple Build Tool [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html), 
which requires that you have at least java 1.6. The build.sbt file has all the requirement definitions and resolvers 

Steps
-----
* Clone the akka-irc repository if you have not done so yet
* Open your terminal and change to the actor-chat directory
* Run 

    `sbt run`

* SBT will download all the required dependencies and provide you with 2 options 

    `Multiple main classes detected, select one to run:
    [1] kaning.actors.ChatClientApplication
    [2] kaning.actors.ChatServerApplication
    Enter number:`

* Please note that this will not be in the same order
* First run the server so in the example above type in 2 and hit return, if in your case the server is the first option type 1
* Open another terminal, change your working directory to actor-chat again and run 

    `sbt run`

* This time choose the client application and identify yourself
* In order to join the server type in _/join_ and hit return

Everything else you type into the client console will be displayed in the server console and to any other clients connected to that server

### Heroku

The server part of this application can be deployed to [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com). You will need a Heroku account
and the and the [toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) installed. Follow [these instructions](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-scala#deploy-your-application-to-heroku)
on how to deploy the application. Other useful commands include:

`heroku logs -t` - Tails the log<br>
`git push heroku akka-actors:master` - Pushes the latest version to heroku<br>

Added persistence at Scala Hack 12th April
